# Abstract

So, about one or two weeks ago, I [redesigned my entire website](https://github.com/irvanmalik48/blog/commit/1559253fb4970a5de36d8bbc526712bc2cf544bf) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It is a CSS framework that, instead of handing you bunch of components, is packed with utility classes to help you build your desired interface stylings faster and easier.
Since I have used it for more than a week now (literally all over the website), I want to give some first impressions for it so here we go.

# First Impressions

1. Creating stuffs from scratch hasn't been more fun and easier.

With Tailwind, I am obliged to forge my own stylings, looks, and overall feels of my website. Thankfully, it's a blessing. It's really easy to make components with Tailwind. I can actually create and style every layout I am currently thinking without even missing a thought (actually, having the skill to visualize your styling and knowing which attributes matters are powerful enough).

2. Very fast and good development experience.

This point synchronizes with the first point. The more synchronized my mind and my hands, the better experience I get, the faster I work on things. Tailwind simply nailed on that. I made the entire layout in 2 days (2 hours each day) and that's really frickin' fast than me doing Bootstrap and needing to get into the documentations to fix some problems and relying on the raped Bootstrap main SCSS imports file (MDBootstrap actually). This is basically a godly upheaval, my ascent to the holy realm of CSS.

> Do note that you actually need some big brain mindpower to be able to visualize stuffs and implement it in real life.

3. Intuitiveness galore.

I can predict what produces what in Tailwind. The names are straightforward. So far my only problem with Tailwind utility class names originates from the `hidden` and `visible` classes (you can also count `invisible` to the mix, a bit confused now?). They're a bit of a pickle to be dealt with but meh, the goodness outweighs the bad stuffs.

4. Purge all the unused classes like a chad.

I can finally say _begone, thot!_ to the manual way of selecting imported SCSS Bootstrap files and casually avoiding deleting useful stuffs. Tailwind provides me with a superpower ability I usually call **purging the hell out of the production-ready CSS file**. It is very very very very very very very useful at reducing the output production-ready CSS file. It also doesn't come with JS script dependency for it to run so yeah, it's really good.

5. Nicely done breakpoint sizes and defaults

Tailwind breakpoint sizes are just... magnificent. Yeah, I'm out of word to describe this so just add something here if you want to.

> Actually, you can send me a pull request to add something in this post.

# Verdict

I am very happy that I ever meet Tailwind and ever took a time to learn it. It is a worthwhile and highly useful experience but that doesn't stop right there. I will still keep learning and improve my skills. I'm still pretty much dumb about anything. There's so much to learn, so much to achieve, so much to improve, so much to fix. And that's not a bad thing at all because I got time to kill my time (damn). Yeah, and thanks for reading this post. Until then, folks!
