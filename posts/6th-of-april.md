# 6th of April

Hi, there. Hope you're good and all. It's been long since you last texted me, eh? I just wanna say sorry for all that I've done to you back then. I know I'm wrong in this regard. I want you to know that the reason why we broke up is to prevent you from experiencing further pain and sins. I distance myself from you not because I hate you. You mean alot to me, don't you know? I just don't want to trap you in the same feeling anymore. I want you to be happy, to be free, to be able to fulfill what you always want. I realized that I'm just a bad person. I can't do anything you wanted me to do. I can't buy you things, I can't take you for a walk, I can't do much by myself. I realized that I can't make you happy. So as my way of redemption, I've let you go to find a new place to hold. A better place for you where all of your dreams come true. A better person than me. Ones that can actually make you happy. Ones that can actually make you smile.

> Be what you want, girl. I'll watch from here.

Let's put it simply, I also will thrive for my dreams. I'm sorry for letting you down, I will do no more. In case you want to know who I am with now, none. I don't want to find anymore. I'm just gonna let it all pass through. I simply surrendered on doing those kind of stuffs. I'm scared of myself and what would I possibly do if I have someone new. I will keep it all closed now. No one gets in, no one goes out. **_Let me suffer alone_** is just a way of honestly telling you that I will eventually be alone again like the old times. I have predicted that you'll go, and I've prepared it in a way that you won't care for me anymore and actually seeks happiness elsewhere. You won't find any positivity in me. You won't find any good if you're still mine.

# Verdict

I hope you see my message. This is the last thing I told to you. You can now chat me again if you want to. I'm sorry for refraining you from ever chatting me. I was just hopeless and kind of down mentally when we broke up and I need time to recover. You can use my accounts, too, if you want to. Alas, this is my message for you. With love, a person you once cared about.
