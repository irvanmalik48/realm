# The Problem

Self healing? More like narcissism. What is self healing anyways? Do you retards even understand the meaning of it? Or you just throw in some words and make it up for your stupid narcissism? What is the point of you getting on a vacation to 'self-heal' yourself while in the end you'll still be what you was? It's like applying a fucking condom to a half-cut penis with no balls. IT'S FUCKING USELESS. You're just making up and using the words 'self healing' to consolidate and embrace your fucking narcissistic nature and fucking get that views and likes and comments. You son-of-a-slut motherfuckers really don't know how life is and how it doesn't give a fuck about your realistically shit temporary condition control OF FUCKING GETTING ENGAGEMENTS IN FACEBOOK PLATFORMS. I am tired of seeing this kind of bullshit everyday either in my story feed or my post feed. I'm really fucking tired of seeing 'self healing time' captions with FUCKING NONSENSICAL COMMENTS leading to NO IMPROVEMENTS or CHANGE whatsoever. I'm fucking tired of how stupidly IGNORANT these people are to reality and their AUDACITY thinking that their IMAGINATIONS AND FUCKING RUNNING-FROM-REALITY situation even matters in real life.

# Verdict

Just stop, really. And fuck you if you're taking this personally.
