## Abstract

A few years back, I made a tutorial on [how to configure Secure Boot on Arch Linux manually](/blog/secure-boot-arch).
It was a long and tedious process, and it's also not really nice to look at.
Now that I reckon it, there's a tool that makes the process much easier: `sbctl`.
Let's just dive straight into it and not waste more time. Y'all pretty much know what Secure Boot is at this point.

## Preparations

First, let's boot into our current Arch Linux installation and backup our current enrolled keys for, you know, safety.
In order to do that, we need to install `efitools` package. If you haven't installed it yet, do so now. (In case you're
new and wondering what the commands are, it's `sudo pacman -S efitools` or whatever AUR helper you're using.)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.secure-boot-backup && cd ~/.secure-boot-backup
for var in PK KEK db dbx ; do efi-readvar -v $var -o old_${var}.esl ; done
```

This will create a directory called `.secure-boot-backup` in your home directory and save the keys in there.

## Installation

Now, let's pop `pacman` into action and install `sbctl`:

```bash
sudo pacman -S sbctl
```

It shouldn't take long unless you have 1 KB/s internet speed. In that case, I'm sorry.

## Getting Into User Mode

Now, let's get our secure boot into user mode. This is necessary for `sbctl` to work properly.
Please reboot to your UEFI settings and enable secure boot but _DO NOT_ boot into system yet.
Instead, go to the secure boot related settings and switch it to user mode by erasing all enrolled keys (don't worry,
we have a backup and the restore to factory settings option repopulates it back anyways).
Disable the secure boot again and boot into your system.

## Configuration

This is what you've been waiting for. Let's configure Secure Boot with `sbctl`.
So first off, let's check for the secure boot status:

```bash
sbctl status
```

It should say `disabled` and `user mode` if you've followed the steps correctly.

### Creating and Enrolling Keys

Let's create a new key pair and enroll it:

```bash
sudo sbctl create-keys
sudo sbctl enroll-keys -m
```

That `-m` flag is to also enroll Microsoft keys. Some systems require it and it would brick without it.
So better safe than sorry.

Right, let's check the status again:

```bash
sbctl status
```

`sbctl` should be installed now, tho secure boot won't work until you pretty much sign your kernel and bootloader.

### Reinstalling GRUB for Secure Boot

Yeah, I admit it, shim-lock is a pain in the ass. So let's just reinstall GRUB to use CA keys instead (you can totally
ignore this step if you don't use GRUB):

```bash
sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=esp --bootloader-id=GRUB --modules="tpm" --disable-shim-lock
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Signing Kernel and Bootloader

You can check what files needed to be signed with:

```bash
sudo sbctl verify
```

You will need to sign the files relative to your system's layout, kernel, and bootloader.
For example, if you're using GRUB, you will need to sign `/boot/EFI/grub/grubx64.efi` and `/boot/vmlinuz-linux`.
Altho, sometimes there's too many files to sign and it's a hassle. So, let's just sign everything:

```bash
sudo sbctl verify | sudo sed 's/✗ /sbctl sign -s /e'
```

This command will sign all the files that need to be signed. You can also sign them one by one if you want to. Oh yeah,
for your information, `sbctl` has hooks set for pacman and some other stuffs so that you don't have to
sign again when you update your kernel or bootloader.

### Enabling Secure Boot

You know the drill. Reboot to UEFI settings and enable secure boot. Boot into your system and check the status again:

```bash
sbctl status
```

It should just say `enabled` now. You're done! You've successfully configured Secure Boot on Arch Linux with `sbctl`.

## Conclusion

I hope this tutorial was helpful and easier than the last time. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to ask
in the comments below. I'll try to help you as much as I can. Have a great day!
